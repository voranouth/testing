Hello World!

Whats up y’all. I am from Kansas and I am a designer. I don’t know what to write about. Woot woot. I like Totoro and Studio Ghibli films. 

I love the color turquoise or mint. I also love to travel.

I work at IBM and I already have a boyfriend named Dat so sorry for this fake Tindr file.
